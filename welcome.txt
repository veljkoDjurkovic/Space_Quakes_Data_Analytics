Welcome!
Our team, made up of Veljko Djurković, Budrak Predrag, and Nikola Lukić, is a group of passionate Electrical Engineering master students driven by a shared love for innovation and problem-solving. We are constantly seeking opportunities to expand our knowledge, refine our skills, and push the frontiers of technology. With a diverse set of technical competencies and a collaborative spirit, we are always eager to take on new challenges that allow us to grow both individually and as a team. United by a vision to contribute meaningfully to the world of science and technology, we strive to turn ideas into impactful solutions that can make a difference. 
The NASA Space App challenge aims to develop a program capable of analyzing seismic data from the Apollo missions and Mars InSight Lander to identify quakes hidden within noisy recordings. By using signal processing techniques such as filtering, RMS energy analysis, and event detection through adaptive triggers, the program efficiently distinguishes between useful signals and noise for effective data transmission.
